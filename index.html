          <p class="intro">Create a design with a story.</p>
          <p class="text">
            I have an aspiration to become a conceptual designer who captures
            various stories through design. Design is not just about pursuing
            visual beauty, but I think it is a powerful tool for conveying the
            stories contained in it. Based on this philosophy, I want to create
            a design that people can relate to and communicate with.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            I believe that the essence of design is not just about the harmony
            of visible elements, but about conveying the messages and emotions
            contained in them. Therefore, my work is always centered around a
            specific topic or story. To this end, I want to study various
            cultural, historical, and social backgrounds and be inspired by them
            to melt them into design. This process allows my work to convey deep
            narratives and emotions beyond simple visual elements.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Also, I think design is a powerful means to have a positive
            influence on people. I believe that design can make people's lives
            better and bring about positive changes in society. Based on this
            belief, I am pursuing sustainable design and socially responsible
            design. This reflects my desire to make the world a better place
            through design, beyond just pursuing beauty.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            I have realized this philosophy through various projects. Each
            project tried to discover new stories and incorporate them into its
            design. The results left a deep impression on people and became a
            medium to tell a variety of stories. In the future, I will continue
            to learn, grow, and create designs that can convey a variety of
            stories.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            My goal is not just to be good at designing, but to communicate with
            the world through design and to move people's hearts. I am
            constantly working on that, and I will continue to walk the path as
            a conceptual designer who incorporates various stories into design.

            <p>
              The history of cameras going into space for the first time was
              designed to look like a grid of newspapers. Photographs taken by
              cameras are meaningful in that they leave visual images of the
              past, and newspapers are also meaningful in that they record
              historical events of the past. By linking the values of these two,
              I tried to express the past history of cameras going into space in
              a grid of newspapers.

              Summer is a season full of lively energy and rich natural beauty
              felt under the hot sun. To convey this visually, fruits of various
              colors were selected and used as design elements. In this process,
              I tried to improve the completeness of the design by carefully
              considering the color combination, arrangement, and ratio.
